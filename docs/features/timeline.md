# Timeline — one time model, one resolver, one owner per parameter

> **State:** **in progress** — commit 1 of 19 shipped (the time base). Nothing below §1 exists in
> the server yet; the plan is `~/.claude/plans/zesty-skipping-engelbart.md` and each section here
> lands with the commit that builds it.
> **Modules:** **not a module** — `src/core/timeline/` (time base, model, resolver, transport),
> `src/core/address/` (one target resolver over the four registries), with the commands in
> `src/protocol/amcp/AMCPCommandsImpl.cpp` and the routes in `src/protocol/http/api_timeline.cpp`
> **Replaces:** `src/modules/keyframes/` (the `KEYFRAMES` command family) and the OFX producer's
> private `OFX KEY` engine — both removed when the resolver lands, with a `CHANGELOG` measurement
> **Coverage:** `time_self_test()` at boot (§1). Batteries arrive with their commits: `timeline-ramp`,

## 1. Time

**Internally, time is a 64-bit count of flicks, 1/705 600 000 s.** Everything else — frames,
timecode, seconds, bars — is a presentation raster derived from it.

**Why an integer.** A resolver compares times constantly: *does this object's start equal that
one's end*, *which of two instances on a layer started later*. Last-started-wins collision is decided
by exactly such a comparison, and with `double` seconds (the old `KEYFRAMES` unit) equality is an
epsilon question — 0.48 s on a 25p channel is frame 11.9999. With frames at the channel rate, one
document cannot play on a 25p and a 50p channel, and a 59.94 end cannot be compared to a 25 start
without rounding.

**Why this integer.** 705 600 000 = 2⁹·3²·5⁵·7². It is exactly divisible by the frame period of
every format this server ships — 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60, 100, 120 and every ×1000/1001 rate — and
by every audio rate (44.1k, 48k, 96k):

| rate | flicks per frame |
| :--- | ---: |
| 25 | 28 224 000 |
| 29.97 (30000/1001) | 23 543 520 |
| 59.94 (60000/1001) | 11 771 760 |
| 120 | 5 880 000 |

So any time in any of those rasters round-trips through a flick count without loss, and a comparison
between two of them is an integer compare. **This is rational time with the denominator chosen
once** — OpenTimelineIO's `RationalTime` becomes `RationalTime(flicks, 705600000)` on export,
exactly. Nanoseconds were the alternative and are inexact at every NTSC frame boundary.

**What is not a time base.** *Drop-frame* is a labelling of a frame count (SMPTE 12M: frame numbers
0 and 1 are skipped at the start of every minute except every tenth, so `00:10:00;00` lands on frame
17 982 of 29.97) and never a base. *Tempo* is a **remap**, `bars → flicks` through
`tempo{bpm, beats_per_bar}` — at 120 bpm 4/4 one bar is two seconds — so a musical timeline and a
video timeline can share one document with different units per object.

**The wire keeps seconds.** A time on `PUT` is a JSON number rounded to the nearest flick;
`{"frames": n}`, `{"tc": "hh:mm:ss:ff"}` and `{"bars": b}` are accepted as literals and converted
against the document's declared `rate` and `tempo`. Every time whose denominator divides the flick
rate survives the round trip exactly, so `0.48` on a 25p channel is frame 12.

**Where it is checked.** `core::timeline::time_self_test()` runs at every server start beside
`binding_math_self_test`, and asserts the one property everything rests on: `flicks_per_frame` has
zero remainder for every rate in the format table plus 29.97 and 48 (which the table does not
carry but LTC chase and imported media will). It also checks the frame round trip at five frame
counts including past an hour, the floor at one flick before a boundary and for negative time, the
`0.48 s → frame 12` wire example, the two SMPTE drop-frame anchors (`00:01:00;02` at frame 1800,
`00:10:00;00` at frame 17 982), and the tempo remap. **The mutation that proves it can fail:**
change `flicks_per_second` by one and the 59.94 exactness check fails at boot.

*Functions:* `flicks_per_frame`, `from_seconds`/`to_seconds`, `from_frames`/`to_frames` (floor),
`to_timecode(t, fps, drop_frame)`, `from_bars`/`to_bars` — all in `src/core/timeline/time.h`.
