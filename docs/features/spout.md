# Spout — GPU texture sharing with other Windows applications

> **State:** shipped, unmeasured
> **Modules:** `src/modules/spout` (producer and consumer)
> **Commands:** none of its own — reached by producer syntax on `PLAY` and by consumer name on `ADD`
> **Architecture:** none, deliberately — a thin wrapper over the Spout SDK; the interesting constraint (adapter-bound shared handles) is in the guide
> **Guide:** [`../guides/SPOUT.md`](../guides/SPOUT.md)
> **Coverage:** **none**

Shares frames with other Spout-aware Windows applications over a shared DirectX texture, with no
host copy. The consumer publishes a channel as a Spout sender; the producer receives another
application's sender as a layer. Windows only.

## 1. What is implemented today

| piece | evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| Consumer — publishes the channel as a named Spout sender | `spout_consumer.cpp:523` (`name()` = `SPOUT`) |
| Producer — receives a named sender as a layer | `spout_producer.cpp:552` |
| Exportable Vulkan texture path | `spout_gl_bridge.cpp:170` uses `create_exportable_texture` |
| Default sender name when none is given | `"CasparCG Spout"`, `spout_consumer.cpp:306` |

**The producer accepts three different syntaxes for the same thing**, which is the detail most
likely to waste someone's afternoon (`spout_producer.cpp:573-581`):

```
PLAY 1-1 "[SPOUT] SenderName"
PLAY 1-1 "spout://SenderName"
PLAY 1-1 SPOUT SenderName
```

All three resolve to the same receiver. The `[SPOUT]` and bare `SPOUT` forms take the name as a
*second* parameter; the `spout://` form takes it inline via `substr(8)`.

---

## 2. How to drive it

Publish channel 1 under a name another application can find:

```
ADD 1 SPOUT NAME "Programme Out"
```

Receive another application's sender as a layer:

```
PLAY 1-1 "spout://Resolume - Composition"
```

Omit the name on the consumer and it publishes as `CasparCG Spout`.

## 3. Design decisions, and what they cost

**Shares a texture, not pixels.** The point of Spout is that no frame crosses host memory, so the
consumer hands over a GPU handle. That is also why this is Windows-only and why it goes through
`create_exportable_texture` — the same allocation path the CUDA producers use.

**It therefore inherited a fix it was never tested against.** That function was returning images
in `eUndefined` to every consumer, including this one, until `0f1c5fb38` transitioned them once at
creation. Spout has no battery, so the fix was verified on the ProRes path and *assumed* here.
Stated plainly because it is exactly the kind of shared-path assumption that this folder exists to
make visible.

**Three accepted syntaxes** rather than one. Convenient for hand-typed commands and for
compatibility with other CasparCG forks' conventions; the cost is three parse branches and no
single documented form, which is why §1 lists all three rather than picking a favourite.

---

## 4. Verification — what is measured, and what is not

**Nothing.** No battery starts a Spout sender or receiver.

Coverage here needs a second process, which is why it does not exist — but it is not impossible:
the consumer and producer in one server can be pointed at each other, publishing from channel 1
and receiving on channel 2, and the received frame compared against the source. That is a real
round-trip check and needs no external application.

Until that exists, treat Spout as working because it is in use, not because it is measured — and
note that the `eUndefined` fix above was never confirmed on this path.

---

## 5. Known gaps

1. **No coverage.** §4 describes a self-round-trip that would need no second application.
2. **The `eUndefined` layout fix is unverified here**, only on the ProRes path.
3. **Windows-only**, with no message explaining that on other platforms.
4. **No documented canonical syntax** — three forms work and none is marked preferred.

## 7. Diagrams

Not warranted on its own. If a diagram is ever drawn for GPU interop generally, Spout is one arrow
on it — see `../architecture/GPU_INTEROP_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
